            A NOTES distribution list is maintained by the Process owner and named WW ME Team. The depository 
            for a completed rating will be the Enterprise Document Management (FileNet)... The distribution list noted 
            below is intended to provide visibility to the various functions that are on the distribution at the time the 
            Rating Criteria was last changed..... adds and deletes due to assignment changes are not noted here
            until a revision is made to the criteria.
